 # 📈 Sales Forecasting using ARIMA

## 📚 Project Overview
This project focuses on forecasting future sales using the **ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average) model**. By analyzing historical sales data, we predict revenue trends for the next 30 days. This can help businesses optimize **inventory management, revenue planning, and marketing strategies**.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Dataset Name:** Sales Transactions Dataset  
- **Source:** [Mention if it's from Kaggle, a company, or simulated]  
- **Number of Rows:** 1000  
- **Columns & Meaning:**  

| Column Name       | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| Transaction ID   | Unique ID for each purchase |
| Date            | Date of transaction |
| Customer ID     | Unique customer identifier |
| Gender         | Customer gender (Male/Female) |
| Age            | Customer age |
| Product Category | Category of purchased product |
| Quantity       | Number of items purchased |
| Price per Unit | Price of one unit |
| Total Amount   | Total revenue from the transaction |

## 🔧 Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, duplicate records, and formatting date fields.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying trends, seasonality, and outliers.
3. **Time Series Transformation**: Making data stationary for ARIMA modeling.
4. **Model Selection & Training**: Using ARIMA(2,1,0) to fit the data.
5. **Forecasting**: Predicting sales for the next 30 days.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Calculating RMSE & MAE for accuracy.
7. **Deployment (Optional)**: Saving the model and creating an API.

## 🔍 Model Selection
The ARIMA model was chosen based on ACF/PACF analysis. The final parameters used:
- **p (AR)** = 2
- **d (Differencing)** = 1
- **q (MA)** = 0

## 🛠 How to Run the Project
### ✅ Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### ✅ Run Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
### ✅ Train & Forecast
Run the `sales_forecasting.ipynb` notebook to train the model and generate predictions.

## 🔬 Model Performance
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** _X.XX_
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** _X.XX_

## ✨ Future Improvements
- Improve forecasting using **SARIMA or LSTM models**.
- Deploy a **Flask API** to serve real-time predictions.
- Add **hyperparameter tuning** for better model accuracy.
